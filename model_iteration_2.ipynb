One of the most interesting concepts I ran into while taking the tutorial was the idea that having multiple algorithms that worked better with a diverse range of elements is better than just relying on one algorithm. Covering more bases and making predictions based on that increased coverage makes the model more likely to be correct, and a lot less likely to be overfit to quirks in the data.\n",

The reasoning behind this was both because I was getting an error and also because it's better practice to ensure the program cleans all the data going into the kaggle test because there might be nans in the test that aren't in the train data."

    "Accuracy: 79.904%\n",
    "Using Ensembling with the old logistic regression algorithm, and a better form of the random forest algorithm, the gradient boosting classifier, the accuracy improved a small amount. Judging by the number of places I moved up in the competition, that small percentage increase is actually pretty close to the best that can be achieved, at least using these algorithms.\n",
    "The improvement makess sense because using multiple algorithms correctly should be better than just using one optimally. That being said, if this is the average of both of the algorithms, there is a chance that just using the one that scored better this time would make the model more accurate at the cost of losing the adaptibility of the model.\n",
    "In regard to where I would like to take this model next, I read a lot of the R tutorial. This tutorial focussed more on creation of the algorithms from the ground up, which I enjoyed much more from a learning perspective than I did the Data Quest tutorial, as there were far fewer black boxes. If I could implement some of the more noticeable trends in the way the survival rate went, I could force the model to predict all old women live and all old men die, because thats close enough to true as to make it a reasonable assumption. The rest, I would leave up to the algorithms to decide."
